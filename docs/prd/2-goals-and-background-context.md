# 2. Goals and Background Context
Goals

Launch MVP to 100 beta users from RevenueGeeks audience
Achieve product-market fit with Amazon FBA sellers
Build foundation for $5k MRR within 6 months ($49 early bird pricing)
Create scalable platform for multi-channel creator discovery
Establish Spreesy Indexâ„¢ as industry standard for purchase-intent matching

Background Context
Businesses waste $25,000-50,000 annually on ineffective advertising while spending 40-60 hours monthly searching for creators across fragmented platforms. Industry research shows average influencer ROI is $5.78 per $1 spent, but top performers achieve $20+. Spreesy solves this by using AI to match businesses with high-converting creators who actually respond to outreach (solving the 85% ignored outreach problem).
Target Users
Primary: Scaling Amazon FBA Sellers ($100k-$2M revenue)

Spending $1,000-10,000/month on Amazon PPC with rising costs
2-20 products in visual categories

Secondary: New Amazon Sellers (<$100k revenue)

1-3 products, $500-2,000/month marketing budget
Getting crushed by PPC competition
Seeking competitive edges
