Spreesy Project Brief
Version 1.1 - Updated: Today
1. Executive Summary
Spreesy is an AI-powered creator matching platform that uses the proprietary Spreesy Index™ to connect businesses with high-converting creators across every digital channel. The platform eliminates guesswork in creator partnerships by analyzing your business and identifying the optimal mix of channels and creators—whether that's newsletter sponsors, YouTube collaborators, blog partnerships, TikTok influencers, podcast guests, or emerging platforms. Starting with Amazon FBA sellers leveraging RevenueGeeks.com's audience, Spreesy helps any business find and prioritize creator partnerships that will actually drive revenue, regardless of where those creators publish.
Tagline: "Stop guessing channels. Start growing revenue."
2. Problem Statement
The Crisis
Businesses face skyrocketing customer acquisition costs (CAC increased 222% over 8 years) while creator partnerships remain inaccessible and unmeasurable. Traditional advertising ROI is declining while costs increase 30-50% year-over-year.
Core Pain Points

Financial Hemorrhage: Average SMB wastes $25,000-50,000/year on ineffective advertising
Creator Chaos: 67% of businesses want creator partnerships but waste 40-60 hours/month with 85% outreach ignored
Platform Fragmentation: Creators scattered across 15+ platforms with no unified discovery
Measurement Black Hole: 73% can't measure ROI; 61% of partnerships fail due to poor matching

Why Current Solutions Fail

Enterprise tools: $2,000-10,000/month, platform-specific, built for big brands
Manual outreach: 10-15% response rate, no quality verification
Agencies: $5,000-20,000/month focusing on vanity metrics, not conversions
Platform tools: Single-channel, limited filtering, enterprise-focused

3. Proposed Solution
The Spreesy Approach
Instead of businesses guessing which channels and creators to use, Spreesy's AI:

Analyzes business type, audience, and offerings
Scans creator ecosystem across ALL platforms
Calculates Spreesy Index™ for each potential partnership
Identifies optimal channel mix for the business
Outputs prioritized list of creator partnerships across multiple channels

Key Differentiators

Performance-First: Focus on creators who convert, not follower counts
Channel-Agnostic: One platform for all creator channels (newsletters to TikTok)
AI-Powered Matching: Predictive success scoring via Spreesy Index™
SMB-Focused: Built for small businesses, not enterprise brands
Accessibility-Optimized: Prioritizes creators who actually respond

The Spreesy Index™ 2.0 (Research-Backed Formula)
Core Formula:
Spreesy Index™ = (PIS × 0.35) + (APF × 0.30) + (CAR × 0.20) + (PPM × 0.15)
Components:

Purchase Intent Signals (35%) - Predicts buying behavior

Review/haul content ratio
Commerce language in comments ("where to buy", "link?")
Affiliate success history


Audience-Product Fit (30%) - Ensures audience alignment

Demographics match
Category relevance
Price point compatibility
Audience authenticity (>73% real followers required)


Creator Accessibility Rating (20%) - Solves the outreach problem

Professional indicators (email, media kit)
Response probability
Content frequency


Platform Performance Multiplier (15%) - Channel optimization

Platform-product match (Beauty→Instagram, Gadgets→YouTube)
Engagement quality relative to platform averages



Score Interpretation:

90-100: "Money Printer" - 8-20x predicted ROI
75-89: "High Performer" - 4-8x predicted ROI
60-74: "Solid Bet" - 2-4x predicted ROI
45-59: "Test & Learn" - 1-2x predicted ROI
<45: "Skip" - Not recommended

7. Constraints & Assumptions
Technical Constraints

Solo developer with AI coding tools (Claude Code)
$500-1000/month infrastructure budget
40-50 hours/week development time
Proven tech stack only (Next.js, Convex, Clerk)

Business Constraints

Bootstrap/self-funded
Email-only support initially
No paid marketing first 3 months
Must be cash-flow positive by month 6

Key Assumptions

✅ Creator data available via API (CreatorDB confirmed)
✅ $49-79/month pricing acceptable (validated)
⚠️ 30% free-to-paid conversion achievable
⚠️ Spreesy Index™ accuracy will improve with data

Primary Risks & Mitigation

API costs escalate → Implement smart caching, rate limiting
Solo founder burnout → Strict 50hr/week limit, automation focus
Index accuracy questioned → Show confidence intervals, gather feedback
CreatorDB alternatives needed → Ready to integrate Modash as backup
